## Problems and Opportunities

#### What tasks do you or your friends wish were easier or faster?
Something I wish was easier is planning my day and getting homework done. My friends like playing football and it would be nice to know where we can watch premier league games.

#### What hobby or passion could benefit from better organization or tracking?
I don’t really plan well when coding or making a website. I also need to manage my homework time better.

#### Is there a game, tool, or interactive learning experience you'd enjoy building?
I might want to make a language learning thing or some sort of platformer

I want to build my web application for planning a schedule and homework tracking because many students are unorganized with homework.

## Key Features

- It will need user input to be stored about what homework
- Should have importance, due date and “size” (color coding)
- Should remember last time it was used
- Should include calendar

## Planning

- As user, I want it to organize tasks and filter by importance for efficiency
- Should display tasks on calendar
- Should remember user data
- Could group similar tasks
- Should look nice
- "As a user, I want to log my tasks easily, so I can keep track of my progress." (Like google tasks)
